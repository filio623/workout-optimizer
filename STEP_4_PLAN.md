# Step 4: LLM Interface - OpenAI Agents SDK Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an AI agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK to provide intelligent fitness coaching and analysis. The approach focuses on building a flexible framework of tools that the LLM can orchestrate to answer any fitness-related question, rather than hardcoding specific scenarios.

## Philosophy & Strategy

### **Core Principles:**
1. **Start Simple** - Learn fundamentals without complexity
2. **Build Incrementally** - Add features as understanding grows
3. **Flexible Framework** - Let LLM do reasoning, provide tools
4. **Avoid Over-Engineering** - Don't code for every possible question

### **Framework Design:**
- **Tools = Capabilities** - Build generic tools, not specific scenarios
- **LLM = Reasoning Engine** - Agent decides how to combine tools
- **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities

## Current State Analysis

### **What We Have (Updated):**
- âœ… **LLM Interface with OpenAI Agents SDK** - Fully functional in `app/llm/interface.py`
- âœ… **Exercise Templates Caching** - Static file approach for instant access (0.00s vs 12s API calls)
- âœ… **Hevy API Integration** - Complete client with all CRUD operations
- âœ… **Function Tools** - 8 tools available to the agent:
  - `get_workout_by_id`, `get_workouts`, `get_routine_by_id`, `get_routines`
  - `get_exercise_templates`, `refresh_exercise_cache`, `get_cache_info`
  - `create_routine`
- âœ… **Routine Creation** - Successfully creates and posts routines to Hevy
- âœ… **Performance Optimization** - Instant exercise access via static JSON file
- âœ… **Organized File Structure** - Clean project organization with `app/data/`

### **What Needs Improvement:**
- **Exercise Selection Logic** - Currently basic random selection, needs muscle group analysis
- **Interactive Conversation** - No back-and-forth dialogue capability
- **Workout Analysis Tools** - Limited analysis of workout history
- **Multi-Routine Creation** - Can't create multiple routines or organize in folders
- **Error Handling** - Basic error handling, could be more robust
